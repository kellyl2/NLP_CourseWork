An RFP/RFQ must be completed for both Competitive Sourcing and Sole/Single sourcing. RFIs are optional and are administered by SCM and Engineering as needed. For further dtails, see Subcontracting RFx Process. For competitively sourced Subcontracts, SCM prepares a Bidders List. If Competitive Sourcing is not performed, a Bidders List is not used because any Sole or Single Sourcing is identified and approved during the Procurement Register Review (see Procurement Register Development and Management). The Bidders List should be approved in accordance with the Approval Authority Matrix. For full details, see SCM Sourcing and Supplier Review. Note: RFQs for low complexity commodities may run a simplified sourcing process. For details see the work instruction Subcontracting RFx Process. To submit a proposal, suppliers must be registered in the Supplier Portal. Registering as a supplier is distinct from and does not equate to being a Pre-Qualified supplier. There may be situations where a supplier requires emergency pre-qualification status. For further details on the pre-qualification process, see the procedure Supplier Pre-Qualification Process.
